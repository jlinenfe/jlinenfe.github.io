    <p>In this project, I worked closely with Good News Book Fair (GNBF), a 10-year-old company whose mission is to distribute Catholic-vetted literature to schools and communities across the United States. As a fast-growing and successful organization, GNBF faced challenges common to rapidly scaling businesses—namely, a lack of centralized, organized data and limited capacity to perform deep analytical reviews of their financial, geographic, and operational performance.</p>
    <p>I took on the role of data analyst to collect, compile, and clean data from several sources including their internal spreadsheets, ShipStation, Clover, Thrive Shopventory, and other vendor platforms. I then conducted a comprehensive analysis using RStudio and Excel to reveal operational bottlenecks, assess market coverage, identify inefficiencies, and provide data-driven recommendations for strategic growth.</p>
    <hr>
											<h3>Background</h3>
    <p>GNBF operates book fairs across the country, partnering with schools to offer literature aligned with Catholic values. While their impact and revenue had grown substantially, the lack of organized data across systems meant they were missing critical insights into which regions were most successful, how product categories performed, and how to streamline operations for future expansion.</p>
    <p>The data I worked with spanned multiple domains—financial transactions, inventory flow, demographic and geographic patterns, customer type, and more. Each dataset came in a different format and structure, requiring careful cleaning, validation, and integration before advanced analysis could take place.</p>

											
                                            <hr>
											<h3>Scenario</h3>
    <p>GNBF leadership had a clear goal: to become more efficient, profitable, and targeted in their outreach and operations. However, their fragmented data made it difficult to understand core business questions such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Where are our strongest and weakest sales regions?</li>
        <li>Which product categories or events generate the highest ROI?</li>
        <li>What demographic and geographic trends can help us better market future events?</li>
        <li>How can we scale without losing control of logistics and inventory?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By integrating and analyzing data across all operational fronts, I provided answers to these questions and uncovered new patterns that GNBF hadn’t previously been able to see.</p>

											<hr>
                                           <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>The primary objective of this analysis was to centralize and analyze the full range of GNBF's operational and financial data in order to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Evaluate current business performance at both national and regional levels</li>
        <li>Identify inefficiencies in inventory, event planning, and product selection</li>
        <li>Highlight key markets and demographics for targeted outreach</li>
        <li>Deliver visual, data-backed insights to support future scaling decisions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ultimately, the analysis was used to inform GNBF’s leadership team on how to optimize their current operations and strategically plan for sustainable growth.</p>

														<h5><b>Revenue & Fair Growth Trends</b></h5>
<p>Analysis of historical data revealed that <b>August and December</b> presented the highest <b>opportunity scores</b>, indicating that these months yielded disproportionately high median revenue per fair despite hosting fewer events. This suggests strong potential for reallocating or increasing resources during these months to improve overall efficiency and return on investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Projections for the next five years</b> suggest continued business growth, with both fair count and revenue expected to increase annually. A linear regression analysis showed an average increase of <b>$2,483 in total annual revenue for every additional fair</b> held in a year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Extrapolating from the 10-year historical growth rate, the number of fairs is projected to rise by <b>72%</b>, while overall revenue is expected to grow by <b>48%</b>. These projections offer valuable insight into future scaling, helping inform planning around staffing, inventory, and budgeting needs as the company continues to expand.</p>

														<h5><b>OCD Symptoms & Severity Analysis</b></h5>
														<p>The most common obsession type is harm-related and the most common compulsion type is Washing. </p>
									                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
									                    <p>The obsession percentage difference between OCD patients with Fmaily History ranged from 2-7% while compulsion had ordering and washing at a percentage difference of above 20%. Washing as a compulsion tended to be more prevelant with people that had diagnosed OCD in their family while Ordering tended to be lass prevelant.</p>

														<h5><b>Treatment & Medication Insights</b></h5>
														<p>The most commonly perscribed medication in the dataset is Benzodiazepine with 386 instances. Although the difference between each medication instance is very small.</p>
									                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
									                    <p>Patients with a longer symptom duration tend to be perscribed SNRI's.</p>

                                    <p><b>Description:</b>I will use the OCD patient dataset for this analysis project, which contains clinical and demographic information on individuals diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The dataset includes variables such as age, ethnicity, symptom types, Y-BOCS scores, and prescribed medications. It was prepared as a single CSV file and analyzed using PostgreSQL and Python. The data represents anonymized patient records and was used to explore trends in symptom severity, diagnosis patterns, and treatment approaches. Below is a map of the table structure prior to data cleaning and transformation.</p>
